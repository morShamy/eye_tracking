Program Work Flow:
	The program contains a main function.
	When running the main function, the user is asked to choose a graph to display, out of 8 valid options, or to exit the program.
	Then, the user is asked to choose an output form: print to screen, or save in a directory  (see explanation about "graphs" folder below).  
	After choosing valid option, the output graph will be printed or saved in a folder, and then the user will be asked to choose again.
	This loop will continue until the user chooses to exit the program. 
	The program uses the raw data excepted from the eye-tracker, as well as data that was manually created (see explanation about "data" folder below),
	
	By default, the program produces the specific graph chosen by the user, with the data of all subjects (1-17), and all eight text types. 
	If you wish to change that - you can edit the "SUBJECTS_NUMBER" and "TESTS_TYPES" tables appear at the top of the python file, under #user control. 
	The same applies to the threshold being used in the success graph, which is by default 0.5 and can be modified.
	
Attached Files:
	1. "data" folder, contains the following files:
		a. "gaze_fixation_by_subject" folder, contains the raw data accepted from the eye tracker device. 
			For each subject, the folder contains two files, one for all gazes, and one for all fixations.
			In each file, you will find the following columns (when only columns i, ii, iv and vii where used):
				i.MEDIA_NAME - name of the test (i.e 10pt1.2sp)
				ii. TIME - fixation \ gaze time apperance, when the time resets at the beginning of each test. 
				iii. FPOGX - fixation \ gaze horizontal l ocation, from 0 (left) to 1 (right).
				iv. FPOGY - fixation \ gaze vertical location, from 0 (top) to 1 (bottom).
				v. FPOGS - fixation time apperance - In both gazes and fixations files, All gazes belong to same fixation will reacive same value.   
				vi. FPOGD - fixation \ gaze duration. 
				vii. FPOGV - is current fixation \ gaze valid, 1 for valid, 0 else.
				viii. AOI - the AOI frame the eye tacker attribute to the specific gaze \ fixation, according to frames assigned manually. 
		
		b. "coordinates.csv" file - contains the coordinates of each row, in each text:
				i. test_type - current test (i.e 10pt1.2sp) 
				ii. row_index - name of the current row in the text (i.e row2)
				iii. X - x coordinate start, meaning the far left location.
				iv. Y - y coordinate start, meaning the top location.
				v.  width -  width of current row, when X + width, is the horizontal location of the row. 
				vi. height - height of current row, when Y + height, is the vertical location of the row. 
		
		c. "summarized_data.csv" file - contains summarized data, written manually by the experimenter:
				i. subject_number - subject number id (from 1 to 17)
				ii. ignore_sample - rather to ignore this sample or not, 1 for ignore, 0 else. 
				iii. test_type - current test (i.e 10pt1.2sp) 
				iv. find row by - the way the target row was reffered in the question (bold \ indented \ number)
				v. question type - type of the question (exist \ count) 
				vi. target_row_up, target_row_down - top and bottom y coordinate of the target row respectively.
				vii.question_row_up, question_row_down - top and bottom y coordinate of the question row respectively.
				vii. focus_start, focus_end - estimated time when the subject was focused on the target row, after reading the question.
				viii. question_start -  estimated time when the subject started to read the question. 
				ix. text_order - order of apperance of the specific text to the specific subject (1-8).
				x.  num of row counting - estimated number of times the subjects counted the rows, before reaching the target line. 

	2. "graphs" folder, contains all results of the data analysis: 
		a. scatter_with_bias_correction - plots of Gazes and fixations distribution for each subject, with and without bias correction.
		b. scatter_no_bias_correction - plots of Gazes and fixations distribution for each subject, without bias correction.
		c. scatter_only_bias_correction - plots of Gazes and fixations distribution for each subject, with only bias correction.
		d. cdf - plots of Gazes and fixations CDF per subject per test. 
		e. time_until_question - plot of time until reaching question, by text order, for all subjects. 
		f. success_summary:
			i. successful_fixations_ratio_per_test.png - percentage of successful fixations, out of total fixations during all focus times for each test. 
			ii.successful_subjects_ratio_with_threshold - percentage of successful sbujects in each test, where subject is successful in a test,
			if his successful fixations ratio is bigger then threshold.
		g. combine_cdf:
			i.  for each subject - a combined cdf for all his tests, after normalization.
			ii. summarized cdf across all subjects, by test type. 
		h. jump_to_question_sequences - csv contains avrage number of times subjects jumped back to the question during focus time, 
			by the question type (exist \ count). 
		i. counting_sequences - bar plot of average number of counting until target line, by way of finding row.
